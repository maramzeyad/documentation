A *package* is a physical container holding one or more products during a picking. Packages can also
be used to store items in bulk.

Packages are commonly used for the following purposes:

#. :ref:`Relocating products from stock <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-use>` to packing or
   outbound areas for delivery.
#. :ref:`Shipping to customers <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`: configure package types
   to align with shipping carriers' size and weight requirements, streamlining the packing process
   and ensuring compliance with carrier shipping specifications.
#. Storing items in bulk.

Refer to the table below for essential package configurations based on different use cases. Skip to
the corresponding sections by selecting the blue link to configure the necessary features for the
intended package usage.

*Package use* is a field on the package form in Odoo that is only visible by enabling the
:guilabel:`Batch Transfers` feature in settings. The default package type is :guilabel:`Disposable`,
so this feature is only required when packages are intended to be used for batch transfers and other
internal warehouse moves.

*Package type* is an optional feature used to create packages with defined dimensions and weight
limits. This feature is mainly used to set templates and ensure packages comply with the shipping
requirements of third-party carriers.

.. note::
   While packages are commonly used in the :doc:`three-step delivery route
   <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`, they can be used in any
   workflow involving storable products.

Configuration
=============

To use packages, first go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under
the :guilabel:`Operations` heading, activate the :guilabel:`Packages` feature. Then, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

Package use
===========

.. note::
   The following section is necessary only when packages are intended to be used for batch
   transfers.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Picking method: batch <batch_transfers>`
   - :doc:`Picking method: cluster <cluster_picking>`
   - :doc:`Picking method: wave <wave_transfers>`

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and activate the
:guilabel:`Batch Transfers` feature, located in the :guilabel:`Operations` section. Doing so makes
the :guilabel:`Package Use` field become visible on a package form.

.. image:: package/enable-batch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Activate the *Batch Transfers* feature in Inventory > Configuration > Settings.

Then, go to the package form to configure the package intended for batch picking. To do that,
navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Packages`.

On this page, add new packages by clicking :guilabel:`New`, or select an existing package. Doing so
opens the package form, which contains the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Package Reference`: (required) name of the package
- :guilabel:`Pack Date`: the date that the package was created
- :guilabel:`Package Use`: choose :guilabel:`Reusable` for packages used for moving products within
  the warehouse; :guilabel:`Disposable` for packages used to ship products to customers.
- :guilabel:`Package Type`: used for :ref:`configuring shipping boxes to ship to the customer
  <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`.

  .. note::
     :guilabel:`Package Type` is unnecessary for configuring batch transfer packages.

- :guilabel:`Shipping Weight`: used to input the weight of the package after measuring it on a
  scale.
- :guilabel:`Company`: specify a company to make the package available **only** at the selected
  company. Leave the field blank if the package is available at all companies.

Add to batch
------------

.. important::
   The following example uses packages in a :doc:`three-step delivery
   <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>` workflow.

   This workflow requires the :guilabel:`Packages`, :guilabel:`Storage Locations`, and
   :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` features to be enabled in :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
   Configuration --> Settings`. On the warehouse configuration page (:menuselection:`Inventory app
   --> Configuration --> Warehouses`), the :guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments` option must be set to
   :guilabel:`Pack goods, send goods in output and then deliver (3 steps)`.

After confirming a sales order, selecting the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button displays the three
tasks to complete the delivery.

   :alt: Clicking "Delivery" smart button displays the pick, pack, ship steps.

To create a batch transfer, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Internal`
and select the checkboxes next to the pick operations that are to be added to the batch.

After the pick operations are selected, navigate to the :guilabel:`⚙️ Actions` button and select
:guilabel:`Add to batch` from the list of drop-down options.

.. image:: package/create-batch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add pickings to batch.

Doing so opens an :guilabel:`Add to batch` pop-up window. Click :guilabel:`Confirm` to finish
creating the batch.

   :ref:`More info about the fields in the 'Add to batch' window
   <inventory/warehouses_storage/add-batch-transfers>`

Pack items
----------

After creating the batch, open the batch transfer and select a reusable package (created in the
:ref:`previous step <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-use>`) in the :guilabel:`Destination
Package` field to place items in the package.

.. example::
   The reusable package, `CLUSTER-PACK-1`, is assigned to the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field
   of all items in the batch transfer, `BATCH/00003`.

  .. image:: package/assign-package.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Assign pickings to a package through the "Destination Package" field.

Alternatively, click the :guilabel:`Put in Pack` button to create a new package and place all the
items in the batch in that newly created package.

.. note::
   Ensure the new package's :guilabel:`Package Use` field is set to :guilabel:`Reusable` by clicking
   the package's :guilabel:`➡️ (right arrow)` icon to open the package form.

.. example::

   Clicking :guilabel:`Put in Pack` creates a new package, `PACK0000002`, and assigns all items to
   it in the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field.

Package type
============

Create package types at :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Package Types` to set
custom dimensions and weight limits. This feature is mainly used to set templates and ensure
packages comply with the shipping requirements of third-party carriers.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Shipping carriers <../../shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`

On the :guilabel:`Package Types` list, clicking :guilabel:`New` opens a blank package type form. The
fields of the form are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Package Type` (required): define the package type's name.
- :guilabel:`Size`: define the dimensions of the package in millimeters (mm). The fields from left
  to right define the :guilabel:`Length`, :guilabel:`Width`, and :guilabel:`Height`.
- :guilabel:`Weight`: record the theoretical weight of the package type. This value is a placeholder
  for when the weight of the contained products is not available.
- :guilabel:`Max Weight`: maximum shipping weight allowed in the package.
- :guilabel:`Barcode`: define a barcode to identify the package type from a scan.
- :guilabel:`Company`: specify a company to make the package type available **only** at the selected
  company. Leave the field blank if it is available at all companies.
- :guilabel:`Carrier`: specify the intended shipping carrier for this package type.
- :guilabel:`Carrier Code`: define a code that is linked to the package type.
