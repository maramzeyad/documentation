Website themes
==============

Odoo offers numerous themes to shape your website's style and customize options, including colors,
fonts, and layouts. When setting up your site using the Odoo website configurator, you are prompted
to select a theme that aligns with your desired aesthetic. If you wish to modify the theme later,
navigate to the website builder, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button, and access the :guilabel:`Theme`
tab. Several sections are at your disposal, allowing you to tailor different aspects of your site to
meet your requirements.

- :guilabel:`Colors`: The Website Builder relies on palettes composed of five colors. Two
  :guilabel:`Main` colors apply to your site's primary and secondary elements, and three
  :guilabel:`Light & Dark` colors apply to your site's lightish, withish, and blackish colors.

  You can also customize the :guilabel:`Color Presets` that have been defined automatically by the
  Website Builder according to the five previously defined color palettes. Click the arrow
  next to a color preset to update it. Each color preset contains colors for your site's
  :guilabel:`Background`, :guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Headings`, :guilabel:`Links`,
  :guilabel:`Primary Buttons`, and :guilabel:`Secondary Buttons`.

  **To apply a color preset** to a building block of your site, select it, go to the
  :guilabel:`Customize` tab, click the :guilabel:`Background` button, and select the one you want.
  If you modify a color preset that has been previously applied to some of your site's elements, the
  colors of those elements will be updated automatically along with the selected preset.

- :guilabel:`Website`: From this section, you can :guilabel:`Switch Theme`,
  :guilabel:`Add a Language`, select the :guilabel:`Page Layout`, and customize the
  :guilabel:`Background` by uploading your own image.

  .. seealso::
     :doc:`Translations <../configuration/translate>`

- :guilabel:`Paragraph`: In this section you can customize the format of the text <p> of your
  website.

  .. tip::
     The :guilabel:`Font Family` field contains fonts that are hosted and served by Google servers.
     To add another font, click :guilabel:`Add a Google Font`, and in the pop up window, click
     :guilabel:`fonts.google.com`.

     Select a font you like, copy the address of the page and paste it in the :guilabel:`Google Font
     address` field, then press :guilabel:`Save and Reload`. The new font applies to your entire
     website.

- :guilabel:`Headings`: In this section you can customize the format of your headings.

- :guilabel:`Button`: Two types of buttons exist in Odoo, the :guilabel:`Primary Style` and the
  :guilabel:`Secondary Style` buttons. You can update the styles from this section as per your
  preference.

- :guilabel:`Link`: This section allows you to edit the style of the hyperlinks available on your
  website.

- :guilabel:`Input Fields`: An input field is a field where you can enter data, e.g., a search bar
  or a form. You can customize these fields from this section.

- :guilabel:`Advanced`: You can hide the header bar of your website using the
  :guilabel:`Show Header` button, inject :guilabel:`<head> and </body>` code, enter your Google Maps
  custom key, change the colors of the :guilabel:`Success`, :guilabel:`Info`, :guilabel:`Warning`,
  :guilabel:`Error` pop up messages by clicking the related :guilabel:`Status Colors` buttons, and
  customize the :guilabel:`Grays` elements of your site.

  .. example::
     - The :guilabel:`Status Color` of the :guilabel:`Success` messages is set to green.
